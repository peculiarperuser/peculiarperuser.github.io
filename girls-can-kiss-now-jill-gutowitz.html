				<p><i> A huge thank you to the author and publisher for providing an e-ARC via Netgalley. This does not affect my opinion of the book. </i></p>

				As a long time Twitter follower of Jill Gutowitz and a pop culture obsessed lesbian, I was incredibly excited to read this book. However, books like this, the ones written by people you love and the ones you spend months looking forward to, are usually a hit or miss. They either become your new favourite or they become a book you wish you never read. I was terrified this book would become the latter. 

				<br> <br> 

				It didn’t. It so, so didn’t, and I couldn’t be happier about it. 


				<br> <br>

				<i>Girls Can Kiss Now</i> is Gutowitz’s reflection on her own lesbianism portrayed side-by-side with the evolution of queer media. The first few essays are pure delight for anyone familiar with lesbian media and pop culture. From queer paparazzi photos to <i>Orange is The New Black</i> to the infamous Kaylor conspiracies, these first few essays felt like a long scroll through Jill’s Twitter. Full of heart and wit that draws you in and becomes addictive in an instant. 


				<br><br>

				And when I thought it couldn’t get better, after all, I was laughing out loud every other paragraph, the essays morphed into something more personal, more poignant. The thing is, I’ve read pretty much every article Jill’s written in the last few years. As a fellow lesbian Swiftie, it was almost impossible to ignore her work. I knew she was a great entertainment writer and I knew she was funny. What I didn’t expect and what I appreciated immensely is just how well she shifts gears to tell personal, heartwrenching stories while still keeping her tone that I’ve grown to love. And the further you get into the book, the more revealing and intimate the essays get but the connection to pop culture never fades. Take the last essay for example - it starts with the release of <i>folklore</i> but then morphs into an incredibly poignant look at life and love in a pandemic. And while the first few essays had me chuckling in a way I expected they would, or more so hoped they would, the very end of the book had me getting misty-eyed in an entirely unexpected way. 

				<br><br>

				<i>Girls Can Kiss Now</i> is a winner. To me, it was one of the most relatable memoirs I have ever read and one I couldn’t get enough of. It’s a book that fulfills the constant need for more joyful lesbian stories in mainstream media because even when the story gets dark, it still feels real and candid, and getting a candid story from a lesbian in mainstream spaces is still not something we see a lot. It brings me joy that such a candid memoir might end up in the hands of a closeted teen lesbian and give her hope when she needs it the most. I understand that, depending on one’s familiarity with lesbian culture and queer media, some people might not find this book as relatable and meaningful as I did, but it’s a book I will not stop recommending any time soon.
