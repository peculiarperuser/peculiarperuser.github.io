				<p><i> A huge thank you to the author and publisher for providing an e-ARC via Netgalley. This does not affect my opinion of the book. </i></p>

				<i>Good Rich People</i> focuses on Lyla and her husband Graham who live with Graham’s mother, Margo, on a property in the hills of Los Angeles. They are extremely wealthy with the money mostly coming from Margo. Graham is a sociopath, his mother a controlling narcissist, and Lyla emotionally unstable but willing to please, to fit it. Margo rents out their guesthouse and together with Grahan plays them until they completely destroy their own lives. Their last “game” ended with a dead body in the fountain, which they blame on Lyla who befriended the dead tenant. Now, it’s Lyla’s turn to destroy the next tenant and prove she is a part of the family.

				I read this book in one afternoon. It’s a page turner. <i>Good Rich People</i> is a perfect mix of soapy and thrilling with an addictive element that won’t let you put the book down. To be entirely frank, I hated each and every character. They are all horrible, unlikeable people and everything each of them does is twisted in absolutely unrealistic ways. However, the POV characters are written brilliantly in a way that almost makes you root for them. Almost. 

				<br> <br>

				I also felt like there was some satire to the whole story. The characters’ wealth and their lifestyles are portrayed in a way that simultaneously feels real and entirely made up. And their desires are portrayed in almost a mocking way that makes them realistic with a hint of satire. I mean, these people play “games” with other people’s lives. That’s their definition of fun. The book is ridiculous, engaging, and twisted in all the best ways. 


				<br><br>

				This book had all the qualities of those classic domestic thrillers that get turned into limited series starring Nicole Kidman. I don’t say this often because I’m not a huge fan of screen adaptations but I would love to see this story played out on screen. Highly recommend this book!
