		    	<h2> MISSING FROM THE VILLAGE by Justin Ling </h2>
		    	<h5>October 23, 2021</h5>

				<br>

				<p> 

				Justin Ling’s <i>Missing from the Village</i> tells the tragic story of serial Bruce McArthur who killed at least eight men in Toronto's Gay Village. 

				<br> <br> 

				While I’m not much of a true crime fan, I picked up this book as a queer Torontonian who had only known about this case from news snippets over the years. Admittedly, I haven’t read many true crime books, but this book didn’t feel like one to me. And Ling said as much in the intro, this book is so much more than just a true crime book. He didn’t just write about the story after the fact, as an investigative journalist, he was actively involved in solving the case since the very beginning. 

				<br> <br>

				Aside from beyond impressive amount of research that went into this book, I was so positively surprised by the attention put onto victims in the story. They weren’t just victims, they were real people with real lives and communities, and this book does a great job in honouring them and their lives. Ling could’ve easily spent the entire book exploring McArthur’s life and character, but instead, it focused on the victims. 


				<br><br>

				Ling’s writing is also a standout. It’s not detached like one might expect from a journalist, it’s very deeply personal, and Ling is critical throughout of the institutions involved in solving the case and issues of bias, power, and privilege within our systems. Ling explores the complicated relationship between the Toronto Police and the city’s LGBTQ community and examines how the homophobia and racism in the system failed the victims. 

				<br><br>

				This book was an incredibly emotional and difficult read but I highly recommend to it everyone. It’s an extremely detailed and comprehensive account of McArthur’s killings but it is also a tribute to the victims and an important conversation about homophobia and racism and how their presence in our systems literally costs marginalized people their lives.
