		    	<h2> LOVE & OTHER DISASTERS by Anita Kelly </h2>


				<br>

				<p><i> A huge thank you to the author and publisher for providing an e-ARC via Netgalley. This does not affect my opinion of the book. </i></p>

				<br>

				<p> 

				<i>Love & Other Disasters</i> follows London Parker and Dahlia Woodson as they compete on a reality cooking competition, Chef’s Special. Dahlia is new divorcée learning to live her life and find her passions as an independent woman. London is a Nashville native looking to use their participation on the show as a means to help others in the queer community afterwards. As they compete against each other on the show, their relationship blossoms, but what happens when the show ends?

				<br> <br> 

				In theory, this is a book I should’ve loved. I expected to love it. In reality, it was an okay read, fun at times, but I failed to really connect with it. 

				<br> <br>

				The cooking competition aspect of the book I truly didn’t care about. The format felt very similar to Masterchef, a show that I actually enjoy very much, but I simply didn’t care about what was happening on Chef’s Special. That side of the plot felt not only secondary but almost like a meaningless filler to the main plot. I think the main reason I felt the way was the fact that I didn’t really care for any of the supporting characters. They were all archetypes of your typical contestants on reality cooking shows and I didn’t find them intriguing enough to pay any attention to them.

				<br><br>

				Now, the main characters, London and Dahlia, were both quite likeable. I enjoyed their dynamics, your classic grumpy/sunshine trope, and some of their banter was excellent. The romance in and of itself was nice as well, though I felt the pacing to be a bit off. I believe it was the pacing that was responsible for the lack of tension I felt between the two. While their relationship was cute, I never got fully invested. 

				<br><br>

				What I appreciated immensely about this book is the queer representation. London, one of the protagonist, is non-binary and uses their participation on Chef’s Special to discuss their identity on television. They even have plans to use their new fame to work with queer youth after the show which is a part of the plot I found quite heartwarming. It’s always exciting to read a queer romance but even more so one with a trans protagonist! 

				<br><br>

				Overall, this book was okay. I would absolutely recommend it if you’re looking for a fun queer romance, but I also believe this premise had so much more potential. I mean, there aren’t a lot of things more intimate and romantic than preparing and sharing delicious foods. Food, in and of itself, is a love language. So I wish this was a tad better read than it was, but because of the potential I believe it had, I look forward to reading Anita Kelly’s next book!
