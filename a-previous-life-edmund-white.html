		    	<h2> A PREVIOUS LIFE by Edmund White</h2>
		    	<h5>October 25, 2021</h5>

				<br>

				<p><i> A huge thank you to the author and publisher for providing an e-ARC via Netgalley. This does not affect my opinion of the book. </i></p>

				<br>

				<p> 

				I’m not entirely sure how I feel about this book. 


				<br> <br> 

				The premise of this book is the tale of a wife and a husband who agree to write their own highly personal and intimate memoirs for the other to read. The book is set in 2050, and they start they stories with their childhoods, Ruggero, the husband, starts in the 1980s while Constance, the wife, starts her tale in the 2010s as they have a 30 year age gap between them. 

				<br> <br>

				I loved this premise and thought it was both incredibly thought-provoking as well as quite romantic. However, as their stories went on, I found myself getting more and more bored. While delightful and humorous at times, it all started getting repetitive for me. Ruggero’s character was also one I didn’t particularly like, he is extremely narcissistic and the longer I read his life story, the more repelled I was by his lack of self-awareness in his own privilege. His narcissism was also felt in his position within the book in contrast to Constance’s, who almost felt like an after-thought.


				<br><br>

				Now, one of Ruggero’s lovers is a gay writer Edmund White. Yes, the author. If I’m being honest, writing yourself in your own book as a fictional character is quite weird. It blurred the lines between fact and fiction. It showed the author in a weirdly intimate light, but I can’t say it didn’t work. It was equal parts strange, intriguing, and funny. 

				<br><br>

				This book is quite a unique one. It is hard to define it, as is to define my feelings about it. It’s strange in a way that is simultaneously repulsive and intriguing. While I found the second half or so of the book to drag and had some irritants when it came to our protagonists, this is definitely a book I will be thinking about for a long time. Whether I recommend it is another question I’m not sure I have an answer to, but if you’re looking for something equal parts charming and infuriating, delightful yet repulsive - this book might be for you!
